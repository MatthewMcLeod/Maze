# Maze

This is a cooperative multiplayer maze. Any player logged in can move the green figurine. Everytime the Maze is solved, a new maze is dynamically generated. Control the green dot with arrow keys and cooperate with other users to reach the end.

An example currently running can be found here: http://64.137.226.205:3000/


To Use:

Clone the Repo and then run install

Then run

node server.js

In the terminal/command line you should be notified that the program is listening to port 3000. You can navigate to that port and everything will be working.

Whenever any player moves the piece it updates the screen of all users.
