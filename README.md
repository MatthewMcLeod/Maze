# Maze

Navigate to folder containing the code
In terminal or commandline, enter

npm install

Then run

node server.js

In the terminal/command line you should be notified that the program is listening to port 3000. You can navigate to that port and everything will be working.

This was inspired from the multiplayer games of pokemon. Players connect to port 3000 and collectively control the green figure in the maze.
Whenever any player moves the piece it updates the screen of all users.
